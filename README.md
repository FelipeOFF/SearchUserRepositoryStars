## Token ‚öôÔ∏è

This project requires a token from github, so that it is possible to make queries using the github graphql API.

For this, it is necessary to follow the [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql) described on the website github

within the scope selection, it is necessary to select the repo scopes and within the scope of user only the option read: user and user: email is required

once the token is acquired you will only need to pass it via environment variable:

`--dart-define=TOKEN_AUTH=YOU_TOKEN`
